### How User Roles Work

1. During registration, users are assigned the **User** role by default.
2. The backend protects admin-only routes using role-based middleware.
3. The frontend dynamically adjusts features based on the user's role:
   - **Admin Features**:
     - Access to the "Add News" section.
     - Ability to edit or delete news articles.
   - **User Features**:
     - View, search, and Profile(edit,delete).

### How to Test User Roles

1. **Signup a User**:
   - Signup without specifying the role, or explicitly set the role to "User".
2. **User an Admin**:
   - Use an admin role by modifying the backend request or directly adding it in the database.
3. **Admin Access**:
   - Log in as an admin and access the "Add News" section.
4. **User Restrictions**:
   - Log in as a User and verify that admin-only routes are inaccessible.
