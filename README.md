How User Roles Work
During registration, users are assigned the User role by default.
The backend protects admin-only routes using role-based middleware.
The frontend dynamically adjusts features based on the user's role:
Admin Features:
Access to the "Add News" section.
Ability to edit or delete news articles.
User Features:
View, search, and Profile(edit,delete).
How to Test User Roles
Signup a User:
Signup without specifying the role, or explicitly set the role to "User".
User an Admin:
Use an admin role by modifying the backend request or directly adding it in the database.
Admin Access:
Log in as an admin and access the "Add News" section.
User Restrictions:
Log in as a User and verify that admin-only routes are inaccessible.
